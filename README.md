# Motion
Creating Motion landing page using Smartgrid layout, which is a new method of  preprocessor grid created by Dmitry Lavrik. Using Smartgrid we do not adding classes in the html code like in the bootstrap3, but only add the mixins to the existing selectors like in bootstrap 4. The accomplished layout in this project is being done by using HTML(BEM), SASS(SCSS), Smartgrid, Flexbox, JS,  Gulp.
